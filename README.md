## Migration Progress

I'm currently in the process of migrating this project to React/Next.js to improve maintainability, scalability, and overall user experience. While the migration isn't complete yet, here's what's been done so far:

- Setup React/Next.js environment
- Ported existing game logic to React components
- Refactored code for better organization and readability

## How to Play

Since the migration is still in progress, the gameplay and features remain the same as described in the original project's Readme. However, expect a more streamlined and responsive experience once the migration is complete.

## Future Enhancements

As I continue to migrate and develop this project, I have exciting plans for future enhancements, including:

- **Improved UI/UX:** Leveraging React's component-based architecture for a more dynamic and engaging user interface.
- **Optimized Performance:** Utilizing Next.js for server-side rendering and other optimization techniques to ensure fast load times and smooth gameplay.

- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Making the games fully responsive for seamless playing across various devices.

- **Testing and Deployment:** Implementing automated testing and setting up a CI/CD pipeline for efficient development and deployment.
